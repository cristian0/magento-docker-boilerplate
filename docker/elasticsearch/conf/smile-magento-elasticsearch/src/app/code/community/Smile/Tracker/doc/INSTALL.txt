Basic installation :
====================

First make sure you have the SmileSearchandising Suite Module installed.
Then, just install the module as usual.


Tracking URL default configuration :
====================================

By default the module is using the built-in image as a beacon.
You should be able to filter tracking into your apache access logs with the following pattern :

   js/smile/tracker/hit.png

This configuration is not adviced into a production environment since it mess up normal access logs and tracking ones.


Custom tracking URL :
====================

You can set up a custom tracking URL into "System > Configuration > Tracking > Tracking Base URL".
You should prefer URL not including the protocol to allow SSL page tagging.

   Example: //hit.mysite.com/hit.png



Use a different vhost:
----------------------

   This is the first way to install a tracking allowing to keep separate Apache access logs from tracking logs.
   You will need a secondary domain for the tracking (eg. hit.mysite.com).


   Create log target folder :
   --------------------------
   
      Even if not mandatory, it is strongly adviced that you create a seperated directory to store the logs produced by the tracker :
      
        > mkdir -p /var/log/smile_searchandising_suite/apache_raw_events

      Following instructions need to be adapted if you don't use the same path as described upon.



   Install the vhost :
   -------------------
   
      The following virtual host allows tracking :
   
      <VirtualHost *:80>
          ServerName <MY_TRACKING_DOMAIN>
    
          DocumentRoot <MAGENTO_ROOT>/js/smile/tracker/

          <Directory <MAGENTO_ROOT>/js/smile/tracker/>
              AllowOverride None
              Order allow,deny
              Allow from all
          </Location>

          RewriteEngine on
          RewriteRule .* /hit.png

          LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"" combined
          CustomLog /var/log/smile_searchandising_suite/apache_raw_events/event.log combined

      </VirtualHost>
      
      Notes : 
        - You need to replace <MAGENTO_ROOT> with the root of your Magento deployment and then reload Apache
        
        - ServerName <MY_TRACKING_DOMAIN> by the FQDN of the tracker
        
        - Be careful about the port into the vhosts. Usually it should be 81 since you will have varnish in front of Magento.
          You should also take care to bypass Varnish for the tracking domain (pass). 
        
        - If tracker code is not deployed yet, reloading Apache will fail. You can fix it with 
           
           mkdir -p <MAGENTO_ROOT>/js/smile/tracker

   Configure log retention policy :
   --------------------------------
   
      Configure logrotate by putting this into /etc/logrotate.d/smile-tracker-log
      
      /var/log/smile_searchandising_suite/apache_raw_events/*.log {
        daily
        dateext 
        missingok
        rotate 7
        compress
        notifempty
        create 640 root adm
        sharedscripts
        postrotate
            /etc/init.d/apache2 reload > /dev/null
        endscript
        prerotate
            if [ -d /etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate ]; then \
                run-parts /etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate; \
            fi; \
        endscript
      }
      
      This allow a daily log rotation and gzip and a seven days retention.


Use fluentd :
-------------

Another great option to proceed to tracking, relay is to use fluentd (proxied by Apache) and espcially with the http-enhanced plugin.
Fluentd can also be used to relay Apache logs to another server used to process the events.
